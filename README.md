## GIFS GIGS GILS

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/JUYkZ9p2qW9g5Z0e6P/giphy.gif)

The purpose of this exercise is to refresh concepts we introduced last year.  
I am providing you with an array of data in `data/giphy.js`

Please create a react application from scratch, clean it up and create this gif gallery.  
When you click on a gif the preview on the right updates.

Import the data in your `App.js` and render them as a list.  
Create one component called `Preview` and import it in your `app.js` component.  
On click the parent component `App.js` should update it's child `Preview.js`.

Concepts that you should look up/refresh and use:

- List Rendering
- Class components
- State/setState
- Parent to child communication
- Props
- SCSS
- React events

Make sure you use the react documentation and the todo-app we already are working on.
We will do it together as well on Tuesday morning.
